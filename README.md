# ADS-B Decoding Guide

This is a small research project conducted by [Junzi Sun](http://junzisun.com) and Air Traffic Management group at the Aerospace Engineering Faculty of TU Delft. While we were trying to work with ADS-B data collected from our receiver, we notice that there are very few documents available which can explain the ADS-B data comprehensively. So, we created this guide, along with a decoder written in python - [pyModeS](https://github.com/junzis/pyModeS).

The main focus of the guide is on reading different types of messages, understanding the information in the message, and decoding/computing aircraft status. This document and related library are shared on GitHub and ReadTheDoc. Please feel free to help us improving them.
