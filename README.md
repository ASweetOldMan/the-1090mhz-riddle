# ADS-B Decoding Guide

This is a small project of on ADS-B decoding, conducted by Junzi Sun, Jacco Hoekstra and Joost EllerBroek, at TuDelft.

While we are trying to experimenting with ADS-B data collected from our receiver, we found out that there were not many documents explaining in detail the entire cycle of decoding the ADS-B message. So we created this guide for everyone who have the same questions, along with a Python library code which is free to use.

The documents are written in reStructuredText, and made with Sphinx. They are also hosted on ReadTheDoc: http://adsb-decode-guide.readthedocs.org/

Feel free to contribute.
