\chapter*{Preface}\label{preface}
Begun with a frustration on the lack of technical public information on
ADS-B and Mode-S in the year 2015, I created a live online document to
record my understanding of ADS-B data. Previously, this was known as
\href{http://adsb-decode-guide.readthedocs.org/}{``ADS-B Decoding
Guide''} project. Together with the tutorial, we also developed its
related Python library, the
\href{https://github.com/junzis/pyModeS}{pyModeS}. With time, I received
many feedbacks, compliments, and contributions from open-source
community users.

Since the beginning of 2017, the interests of tapping into Enhanced
Mode-S (EHS) data brought us a whole new chapter of Mode-S inference and
decoding into the pyModeS. This also enriches the ``ADS-B'' guide. With
the advance in this area, I am planning to compile a more comprehensive
online book to cover both ADS-B and Mode-S decoding and related topic.

That's the starting of this new repository. I am also starting to host
the online book on my own server to allow more flexibility of editing
and publishing. You can read the most up-to-date book on
\href{http://mode-s.org}{mode-s.org}.

Oh, it is still GNU GPL. It was great to see the pull requests from
different contributors previously. I am looking forward to seeing more
comments and pulls from the community. Enjoy!
